    This website was made for my partner and her art. It has a full CMS.

CMS with full CRUD operations, allowing the user to add their artworks with an image to be displayed.
You can also update or delete any painting uploaded.

The artwork is displayed in a pinterest like masonry grid implemented with flexbox.

It uses supabase for auth and a hosted DB.

Also using Supabase for S3, which is really AWS.

The frontend is hosted with firebase hosting

The dotnet backend API is containerized and the image is hosted on railway

cloudflare for domain + protection.

Stack-

Frontend: TypeScript, Angular, firebase hosting, HTML, CSS, JS

Backend:Dotnet API, REST api's, postgressql, firebase, supabase, docker, railway, S3
