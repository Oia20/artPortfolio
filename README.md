This website was made for my partner and her art. It has a full CMS.

CMS with full CRUD operations, allowing the user to add their artworks with an image to be displayed.
You can also update or delete any painting uploaded.

The artwork is displayed in a pinterest like masonry grid implemented with flexbox.

It uses supabase for auth and a hosted DB.

The frontend is hosted with firebase hosting with cloudflare for domain + protection.
